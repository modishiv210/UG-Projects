 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.672   TIME= 22:20:57
 Temperature-dependent properties have not been specified.  The          
 THOPT,QUASI option does not perform equilibrium iterations.  Small      
 time steps may be required to obtain accurate results.                  

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.828   TIME= 22:20:57
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.953   TIME= 22:20:57
 Material number 2 (used by element 20001) should normally have at least 
 one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of energy by  
 material may not be available.                                          

 *** ERROR ***                           CP =       6.500   TIME= 22:21:02
 The value of TEMP at node 2637 is 1308055.7.  It is greater than the    
 current limit of 1000000 (which can be reset on the NCNV command).      
 This generally indicates that there are no temperature constraints or   
 convections applied.
