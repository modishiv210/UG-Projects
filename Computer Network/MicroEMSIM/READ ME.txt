This file gives detailed instructions for executing MicroEMSIM program.

Note: All the input and output files can be read in Notepad or any text editor. 

Step 1: Make sure the folder that contains 'MicroEMSIM.exe' also has following files
'kphi.txt', 'micro.txt', 'serration.txt' and 'main.inp' (the main input file).
main.inp contains machining parameters and its name can be changed to any arbitrary name (e.g. test1.inp)

Step 2: Open 'command prompt' from the start menu. In Windows 7 or Windows 10, this can be done by typing 'cmd' in the search window inside start menu.

Step 3: Navigate to the folder containing all the MicroEMSIM program files.  
For example, suppose the folder containing all the 'MicroEMSIM' program files is named FolderC and it is located at 'F:\FolderA\FolderB\FolderC\'
then, first type 'F:' (without quotes) and press enter (this changes the drive to F:\>)
then, enter 'cd FolderA\FolderB\FolderC' to navigate to the 'FolderC'. Now you should see 'F:\FolderA\FolderB\FolderC>' in the command prompt

Step 4: Execute the input file by entering command 'MicroEMSIM main' 
Here main is the name of the input file. 

Step: Make sure the outputs files with suffix 'main' have been generated in the same folder.
