 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.188   TIME= 13:55:15
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.

 Material number 19 (used by element 10873) should normally have at      
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.312   TIME= 13:55:15
 Maximum friction coefficient 0.5 is defined in the model.  Switch to    
 the unsymmetric solver (NROP,UNSYM) instead if convergence difficulty   
 is encountered.                                                         

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.156   TIME= 13:55:16
 Coefficient ratio exceeds 1.0e8 - Check results.                        

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      14.984   TIME= 13:55:29
 Table _FIX is an ANSYS reserved table name.  It is used to constrain    
 structural degrees of freedom to their current displaced status.  This  
 table should not be used for other purposes.
